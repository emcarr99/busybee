# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description 
A simple application that allows users to schedule their work day. Users are able to see what has happened, what is coming, and what is currently happening. All shown by color coding. Enjoy being a busy bee!

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
You can find the Busy Bee Scheduler here: 

Upon clicking the link you will be taken to your scheduler. Where you will be met by Mr. Busy Bee! You'll also see the current day & time.



To fill out the schedule simply click on the blank space next to the time spot you want, and start typing. If you want the event you just typed to STAY there even if you close the window, click the 'heart' and when you reload the page your item will still be there!

What if its a new day! Do i have to go delete every single thing I wrote? No! Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click 'Clear All' to completely erase any saved input.

Now the only thing left to do is schedule! (and do laundry).
